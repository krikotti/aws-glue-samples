# Find Matches Examples

This directory contains examples of using the [FindMatches ML Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/machine-learning.html) The FindMatches transform enables you to identify duplicate or matching records in your dataset, even when the records do not have a common unique identifier and no fields match exactly. This will not require writing any code or knowing how machine learning works.
